### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-minded frontend engineer bridging design, development and customer needs.  
Experienced in leading teams and building real-world products across domains – from digital to manufacturing.  
Coding since 2017.

For the past 2.5 years I’ve applied my engineering & product mindset to tea manufacturing.  
It’s been a fun and rewarding experiment — now it's time to return to tech.  
Industry hasn't change much — my skills remained sharp, I simply caught up on AI stuff.
